# XLS-66 Lending Protocol & XLS-65 SAV — DAP

A full-stack reference implementation of the XRP Ledger's lending amendments:
[**XLS-66** (Lending Protocol)](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0066-lending-protocol)
and [**XLS-65** (Single Asset Vault)](https://github.com/XRPLF/XRPL-Standards/tree/master/XLS-0065-single-asset-vault).
Built as an open-source template for fintechs, asset managers, and devs who want a working starting point for lending/borrowing products on XRPL.

- Three roles — **Loan Broker**, **Depositor**, **Borrower** — each with a
  dedicated dashboard and wallet.
- Full loan lifecycle: origination (multi-sign), regular / late / early-full /
  overpayment repayment modes, default, and cleanup.
- Three asset types supported: **XRP**, **IOU**, **MPT** (XLS-33).
- On-chain correctness verified against the latest XLS-66 / XLS-65 / XLS-33
  master specs; every non-obvious calculation has a spec-section reference in
  the code.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This code is provided **as is**. It has **not been audited**, there is **no
guarantee that it will be maintained**, and it should be considered **for
test and educational purposes only** — **not for Mainnet** or any
deployment that handles real value. Forking and adapting it is encouraged;
running it unmodified against live funds is not.

## Prerequisites

Set these up **before** the Quick Start:

- **Node.js 20+** and npm.
- **An Auth0 tenant** (free tier is fine) — a Regular Web Application for Universal Login. See [Auth0 Setup](#auth0-setup).
- **A MongoDB database** — a free Atlas cluster or a local Docker instance. See [MongoDB Setup](#mongodb-setup).

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local              # then edit MONGODB_URI and Auth0 credentials
npm install
npm run dev                              # http://localhost:3000
```

Sign up or log in via Auth0 Universal Login. On first authenticated request
the server generates four wallets (broker, depositor, borrower, issuer),
funds them via the devnet faucet, and persists their seeds — encrypted at
rest (see [Security notes](#security-notes)) — in MongoDB for the session.

## Environment variables

| Variable             | Default                                              | Purpose                                   |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `XRPL_NETWORK_URL`   | `wss://s.devnet.rippletest.net:51233/`               | WebSocket endpoint                |
| `XRPL_FAUCET_URL`    | `https://faucet.devnet.rippletest.net/accounts`      | Devnet faucet                             |
| `XRPL_SOURCE_TAG`    | *(optional, unset)*                                  | 32-bit uint stamped as `SourceTag` on every submitted tx for on-chain analytics |
| `MONGODB_URI`        | *(required, no default)*                             | Full MongoDB connection string            |
| `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | *(required, no default)*                          | 32-byte base64 key that encrypts wallet `seed` / `privateKey` at rest. Generate with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `AUTH0_SECRET`       | *(required, no default)*                             | Secret for Auth0 session encryption       |
| `AUTH0_DOMAIN`       | *(required, no default)*                             | Auth0 tenant domain (e.g., `tenant.auth0.com`) |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`    | *(required, no default)*                             | Auth0 application Client ID               |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET`| *(required, no default)*                             | Auth0 application Client Secret           |
| `APP_BASE_URL`       | `http://localhost:3000`                              | Application base URL (used in redirects)  |

See `.env.example`. Network and faucet default to Devnet because XLS-66/65 are
only enabled there at the time of writing. `WALLET_ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be set
before first login — the same key is required to decrypt existing wallets, so
keep it stable (losing it makes stored seeds unrecoverable) and store it in a
secrets manager in production.

### Auth0 Setup

This demo uses Auth0 Universal Login. To run it locally you need an Auth0
tenant and a Regular Web Application.

1. Sign up at https://auth0.com and create a new tenant (free tier is fine).
2. **Applications → Create Application** → "Regular Web Application".
3. In the application **Settings**:
   - Allowed Callback URLs: `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
   - Allowed Logout URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Allowed Web Origins: `http://localhost:3000`
4. **Authentication → Database → Username-Password-Authentication → Settings**:
   - Enable "Requires Verified Email"
   - Set Password Policy to "Good" or stronger
5. **Authentication → Social**: disable all social connections (email-only
   for this demo).
6. Copy the application Domain, Client ID, and Client Secret into
   `.env.local` (see `.env.example`).
7. Generate `AUTH0_SECRET` with `openssl rand -hex 32` and add it to `.env.local`.

### MongoDB Setup

The app stores session data (wallet records, vault / loan mappings) off-chain in
MongoDB. Use either a free cloud cluster or a local instance.

**Option A — MongoDB Atlas (free tier):**

1. Sign up at https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas and create a free **M0** cluster.
2. **Database Access** → add a database user (username + password).
3. **Network Access** → allow your IP (or `0.0.0.0/0` for quick local testing).
4. **Connect → Drivers** → copy the connection string and add a database name, e.g.
   `mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/xls66-lending?retryWrites=true&w=majority`
5. Put it in `.env.local` as `MONGODB_URI`.

**Option B — local Docker:**

```bash
docker run -d --name xls66-mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

Then set `MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/xls66-lending` in `.env.local`.

## Tech stack

- **Framework** – Next.js 16 (App Router, React 19, TypeScript, Turbopack)
- **Auth middleware** – `src/middleware.ts` (cookie gate + same-origin CSRF check)
- **UI** – Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/ui, Aceternity UI, Magic UI, Motion
- **XRPL** – xrpl.js v4 (includes XLS-65/66/33 validators and flag enums)
- **Database** – MongoDB (Mongoose) — see "On-chain vs off-chain" below

## Architecture: on-chain vs off-chain

**The XRPL ledger is the source of truth.** MongoDB caches only what's needed
to bridge HTTP requests between transactions.

### Written to the ledger

| Object / Tx                           | Path                                                    |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Vault` (XLS-65)                      | `VaultCreate` / `VaultDeposit` / `VaultWithdraw` / `VaultDelete` |
| `LoanBroker` (XLS-66)                 | `LoanBrokerSet` / `LoanBrokerCoverDeposit` / `LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw` / `LoanBrokerDelete` |
| `Loan` (XLS-66)                       | `LoanSet` (multi-sign) / `LoanPay` / `LoanManage` / `LoanDelete` |
| `MPTokenIssuance` + `MPToken` (XLS-33) | `MPTokenIssuanceCreate` / `MPTokenAuthorize`            |
| IOU trust lines                       | `TrustSet` + `AccountSet` (`asfDefaultRipple`)          |
| Faucet top-ups, peer transfers        | `Payment`                                               |

### Read from the ledger on every request

| Data                                               | Method                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Wallet XRP balance                                 | `account_info` → `Balance`               |
| IOU balance                                        | `account_lines` filtered by issuer       |
| MPT balance                                        | `account_objects` type `mptoken`         |
| Vault state (`AssetsTotal`, shares, MPTID, …)      | `vault_info` (returns the full entry)    |
| Loan / LoanBroker state                            | `ledger_entry` with the object id        |
| Validated close time (for interest accrual)        | `ledger` with `ledger_index: "validated"` |

### Stored off-chain (MongoDB, `src/lib/db/models/`)

| Collection       | Role                                                                                  |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `UserWallets`    | Auth0 `sub`, cached email, generated wallet seeds, current `vaultId` / `loanBrokerId` / `issuedToken` discriminator. **`seed` and `privateKey` are encrypted at rest (AES-256-GCM) and never leave the server.** Credentials are owned by Auth0; this collection holds no password material. |
| `Vault`          | User ↔ `vaultId` mapping + asset record + cached `totalDeposited` / `sharesMinted`. Refreshed from `vault_info` on read. |
| `Loan`           | User ↔ `loanId` mapping + immutable loan terms (copied from the `LoanSet` payload at origination) + cached `paymentsRemaining` / `principalOutstanding` / `status`. |
| `DepositHistory` | Audit trail of every `VaultDeposit` / `VaultWithdraw`, with tx hash, amount, type, timestamp. Used for PNL in the depositor view. |
| `RateLimit`      | Fixed-window request counters (keyed per user or per IP) with a TTL index. Backs API rate limiting; documents are purged automatically once their window expires. |

**MongoDB is never the source of truth for balances or state** — every
protected route re-reads the ledger after a tx and after a page load. The DB
exists so the frontend can render without doing a full ledger scan on every
render and so historical tx data survives the ephemeral `Loan` / `Vault`
ledger entries (they're deleted at cleanup).

### Sync flow after a write

```
1. Build tx with lib/xrpl builders (buildVaultCreate, buildLoanSet, …)
2. Sign (or multi-sign for LoanSet)
3. submitAndWait → ledger processes in next close
4. assertTxSuccess() checks meta.TransactionResult === "tesSUCCESS"
5. Re-query the ledger (vault_info / ledger_entry) for fresh state
6. Update the matching Mongo document with the unscaled on-chain values
7. Return the tx hash + minimal cache to the client
```

## Amount conventions (important for forkers)

The three supported asset types represent amounts differently on-chain; the
template normalizes this at API boundaries:

| Asset | On-ledger                                   | DB / API payloads                     |
| ----- | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| XRP   | integer **drops** (1 XRP = 1 000 000 drops) | drops                                 |
| IOU   | decimal string, up to 16 sig figs           | decimal string                        |
| MPT   | integer, scaled by `AssetScale` (demo = 2)  | **decimal string** (scaled at tx boundary) |

MPT scaling is the only place the client and the ledger disagree. Helpers in
`src/lib/xrpl/helpers.ts` scale / unscale at the exact two boundaries where
this matters:

- `buildAmountField(issuedToken, humanAmount)` — builds the `Amount` field
  for `VaultDeposit` / `VaultWithdraw` / `LoanPay` / `Payment` and scales
  up for MPT.
- `unscaleVaultNodeForMPT(vault, isMPT)` / `unscaleLoanNodeForMPT(node, isMPT)`
  scale down every amount-typed field before the API returns a ledger entry
  to the client.

Rate fields (`InterestRate`, `LateInterestRate`, `CloseInterestRate`,
`OverpaymentInterestRate`, `OverpaymentFee`, `ManagementFeeRate`,
`CoverRateMinimum`, `CoverRateLiquidation`) are always in **1/10 bps** on the
ledger (1 unit = 0.001%). Conversions live in `src/lib/constants.ts`:

```ts
percentToTenthBps(1)   // 1000        — UI % → on-chain units
bpsToTenthBps(500)     // 5000        — stored bps → on-chain units
tenthBpsToPercent(5000) // 5          — on-chain units → display %
```

## Loan math

All spec-critical calculations live in `src/lib/loan-math.ts` and are
deliberately isolated from UI and network code so they're easy to reuse
server-side or port to other clients.

| Function                 | XLS-66 reference            | Output                      |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `amortize(...)`          | §A-2.1 formulas (5)–(7)     | `{ periodicPayment, totalOutstanding, totalInterest }` |
| `earlyFullPayment(...)`  | §A-3.2.4 (early close)      | `{ accruedInterest, prepaymentPenalty, totalDue }` |
| `latePayment(...)`       | §A-3.2.2 (late payment)     | `{ lateInterest, totalDue }`                  |

For full-repay and late-repay modes the server re-computes the total on the
latest validated ledger close time via
`computeFullPaymentAmount` / `computeLatePaymentAmount` in
`src/lib/xrpl/helpers.ts`, so client clock drift can't push the amount below
the ledger's threshold.

## LoanPay flags (XLS-66 §A-3.3)

| Flag                  | Value      | When we set it                                                     |
| --------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `tfLoanLatePayment`   | `0x040000` | Auto-set when `now > Loan.NextPaymentDueDate`                       |
| `tfLoanFullPayment`   | `0x020000` | UI "Pay in full" mode                                              |
| `tfLoanOverpayment`   | `0x010000` | UI "Overpayment" mode; loan must have been created with `tfLoanOverpayment` set on `LoanSet` |

Without the appropriate flag the ledger either rejects the tx or falls
through to the regular-installment path, which is why the close fees / late
fees configured at origination don't appear to be enforced unless the flag is
present.

## Cleanup order

Deleting a vault requires dismantling the dependency chain first:

```
For each active loan:
LoanManage (tfLoanDefault) → LoanDelete
LoanBrokerCoverWithdraw
LoanBrokerDelete
VaultDelete
```

`/api/vault/delete` runs this entire sequence in one call. Any out-of-order
step surfaces as `tecHAS_OBLIGATIONS`.

## User flow

```
Sign in / Sign up (Auth0 Universal Login) → Email verified → 4 wallets created + faucet-funded
 ├── Broker    → Create vault → Register broker (+ first-loss cover) → Issue loan → Manage / default
 ├── Depositor → Deposit → Track PNL → Withdraw
 └── Borrower  → View loan → Make payment (installment / late / full / overpayment / custom)
```

## API surface

All routes below are described by an **OpenAPI 3.1** spec at
[`docs/openapi.yaml`](./docs/openapi.yaml). While running the dev server
the same file is served from:

- `GET /api/openapi` — raw YAML (or JSON with `Accept: application/json`)
- `GET /api/docs` — Swagger UI rendering of the spec

All routes are protected by `src/middleware.ts` — the Auth0 SDK session
cookie is required. The caller's identity (`auth0Sub`) is resolved from the
cookie by the SDK, never from the request body or query, so cross-session
IDOR is impossible. Public exceptions (exact-match): `GET /auth/login`,
`GET /auth/callback`, `GET /auth/logout`, `GET /api/openapi`,
`GET /api/docs`, `POST /api/csp-report`. Mutating requests are additionally
gated by a same-origin `Origin`-header check. Every response carries a strict
nonce-based **Content-Security-Policy** (`src/middleware.ts`), and the
transaction and wallet-provisioning endpoints are **rate-limited**
(`src/lib/rate-limit.ts`).

- **Authentication**: delegated to Auth0 via Universal Login (email-only
  in the default config; social providers can be enabled in the Auth0
  dashboard). Passwords are managed by Auth0 and never stored in this
  application. The user's stable identity is the Auth0 `sub` claim,
  persisted on `UserWallets.auth0Sub`.
- **Session routing**: the Auth0 SDK reads identity from an encrypted
  httpOnly cookie it manages — never from a request body or query.
  `src/middleware.ts` gates every protected route via `auth0.getSession()`.
- **CSRF**: mutating requests must carry an `Origin` matching the request
  host (enforced in `src/middleware.ts`). Server-side tools without `Origin`
  pass through, but they need a valid auth cookie anyway.
- **Per-row authorization**: `/api/loan/[id]` and `/api/vault/[id]` scope
  their DB lookup by the caller's `UserWallets._id` so authenticated callers
  can't read other users' loan / vault records by guessing an id.
- **Server-side validation**: every amount / number / id is validated before
  being used in a tx. See `src/lib/validation.ts`.
- **On-chain verification**: `assertTxSuccess(result, txType)` throws on
  anything other than `tesSUCCESS`, so the DB never records an assumed state.
- **Demo wallets are server-controlled.** Even with seeds encrypted at rest
  (above), a real lending product wouldn't give one server custody of the
  broker, depositor, and borrower keys at the same time — each role should
  be a distinct user with their own wallet.

## Out of scope (TBD)

- Private vaults with `PermissionedDomain` credentials (XLS-80)
- Collateralized loans using `TokenEscrow` (XLS-85)
- Batch issuance with XLS-56
- Secondary share market (vault share trading)
